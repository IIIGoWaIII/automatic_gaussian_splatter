# Automatic Gaussian Splatter

A streamlined, web-based interface for generating high-quality 3D Gaussian Splats from images or videos. This tool integrates **COLMAP** for sparse reconstruction, **Brush** for optimized training, and **Apple's ML-Sharp** for single-image 3DGS generation. All the links are generated by AI. Check if they are the correct ones.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IIIGoWaIII/automatic_gaussian_splatter.git
    cd automatic_gaussian_splatter
    ```
2.  **Start the WebUI**:
    Run the following batch file to set up the virtual environment and start the server:
    ```bash
    .\python_webui\run_app.bat
    ```
3.  **Install Components**:
    Once the WebUI opens (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), go to the **Updates** section to download and install:
    - **COLMAP** (Windows CUDA binaries)
    - **Brush** (Windows binaries)
    - **ML-Sharp** (Requires Python 3.13)

## 💻 Requirements

### Hardware
- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
- **RAM**: 16GB+ recommended

### Software Prerequisites
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
- **Python 3.13**: [Download Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/)
    - > [!IMPORTANT]
    - > **Python 3.13 is mandatory** for the ML-Sharp (Single Image 3DGS) component. While the WebUI may start with older versions, the full pipeline requires 3.13.
- **CUDA Toolkit**: Recommended for optimal performance with COLMAP and Brush.

## 🛠️ Components

### 1. COLMAP
Handles the initial sparse reconstruction (Structure-from-Motion) from your image datasets or video frames. The app automatically manages the download of pre-built Windows CUDA binaries.

### 2. Brush
A high-performance Gaussian Splatting trainer. It features a real-time viewer and supports training from scratch or resuming from previous checkpoints.

### 3. ML-Sharp (Single Image 3DGS)
Incorporates Apple's ML-Sharp model to generate 3D Gaussian Splats from a single image. This requires a significant download (~2GB dependencies + ~500MB model checkpoint) which is handled by the built-in update manager.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `python_webui/`: Core FastAPI server and Web interface.
- `ml-sharp/`: Local installation of the ML-Sharp component.
- `colmap-x64-windows-cuda/`: Managed COLMAP installation.
- `brush-app-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/`: Managed Brush installation.
- `processing_output/`: Default location for all your 3DGS projects.

## 🤝 Troubleshooting

- **SSL Errors**: If ML-Sharp fails to download the model checkpoint due to SSL issues, the app includes a fallback mechanism to bypass verification.
- **Python Not Found**: Ensure Python 3.13 is in your system PATH or use the `py` launcher if available.
